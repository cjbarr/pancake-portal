Pancake Portal is a pancake-themed website created in React as a platform to refresh my react.js experience. I personally love pancakes, and it's a fun project to mess around in and research new technologies to incorporate. Server is hosted by AWS RDS.

To run the application locally:

npm run server

npm start
